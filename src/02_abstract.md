Abstract

The global transition toward carbon neutrality by 2050 has led to a surge in demand for battery metals—essential components for lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles and stationary energy storage systems. According to projections by the International Energy Agency (IEA), demand for lithium is expected to increase approximately 13-fold, while cobalt and nickel demand is projected to increase more than 6-fold over the next two decades. However, the supply of these critical metals faces significant risks due to resource concentration in specific countries and geopolitical factors. For instance, approximately 70 % of global cobalt production is concentrated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, while lithium production is heavily dependent on the "Lithium Triangle" in South America and Australia. As a potential solution to ensure stable supply, deep-sea mineral resources, particularly manganese nodules, have attracted considerable attention. In Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) around Minamitorishima Island, vast deposits of manganese nodules containing valuable battery metals (Co, Ni, Cu) have been discovered, with estimated reserves equivalent to more than 75 years of Japan's annual consumption.

The commercialization of manganese nodules requires the development of efficient and economical smelting processes suitable for their unique physical and chemical properties, including high water content (approximately 30 %) and porous structure. While various leaching methods have been proposed for manganese nodules from other regions, the applicability of these methods to nodules from the Minamitorishima area, which exhibit different compositions and physical characteristics, has not been sufficiently verified.

This study aimed to evaluate and compare three leaching methods for manganese nodules collected from the Minamitorishima area: sulfuric acid leaching, oxalic acid leaching, and ammonia-ammonium carbonate solution leaching. Leaching experiments were conducted under various conditions, and the leaching rates of Ni, Co, Cu, Mn, and Fe were determined. Additionally, the economic viability of each process was evaluated based on reagent costs, energy costs, processing time, and recovery rates of valuable metals.

The elemental composition analysis revealed that the nodules contained Mn (16.11 wt %), Fe (17.00 wt %), Co (3,712 ppm), Ni (2,008 ppm), and Cu (1,654 ppm). In sulfuric acid leaching experiments, optimal conditions of 100 °C, 2 M sulfuric acid, and 120 minutes resulted in nearly 100 % recovery rates for Ni and Cu, but only approximately 23 % for Co. Oxalic acid leaching at 0.3 M and 25 °C (ambient temperature) for 120 minutes achieved high recovery rates (approximately 100 %) for Ni, Co, and Cu. However, oxalic acid also dissolved Mn and Fe, and during the subsequent separation process, oxalate salts formed readily, trapping valuable metals (Ni, Co, Cu) within them, which represents a significant technical challenge. Ammonia-ammonium carbonate solution leaching of unroasted samples at 50 °C with 15 % NH~3~-9 % CO~2~ for 120 minutes showed overall low recovery rates (Cu: approximately 46 %, Ni: approximately 7.5 %, Co: approximately 2.1 %).

Economic evaluation considering reagent costs, energy costs, processing time, and recoverable metal quantities indicated that sulfuric acid leaching exhibited the highest profitability. While oxalic acid leaching had lower energy costs, the technical issue of valuable metal loss due to oxalate salt formation during Mn and Fe removal prevents it from being superior to sulfuric acid leaching unless this problem is resolved. Ammonia-ammonium carbonate solution leaching had low reagent costs but showed low recovery rates and high energy costs, resulting in lower profitability compared to the other two processes.

In conclusion, sulfuric acid leaching (100 °C, 2 M, 120 minutes) is the most suitable process for the commercial utilization of manganese nodules from the Minamitorishima area. However, the low Co recovery rate (approximately 23 %) remains a challenge, and the development of technologies to improve Co recovery is an important future research topic. Additionally, solving the problem of valuable metal loss due to oxalate salt formation in oxalic acid leaching would be crucial for achieving high Co recovery rates.
