Abstract

The global transition toward carbon neutrality by 2050 has led to a surge in demand for battery metals—essential components for lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles and stationary energy storage systems. According to projections by the International Energy Agency (IEA), demand for lithium is expected to increase approximately 13-fold, while cobalt and nickel demand is projected to increase more than 6-fold over the next two decades. However, the supply of these critical metals faces significant risks due to resource concentration in specific countries and geopolitical factors. For instance, approximately 70 % of global cobalt production is concentrated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, while lithium production is heavily dependent on the "Lithium Triangle" in South America and Australia. As a potential solution to ensure stable supply, deep-sea mineral resources, particularly manganese nodules, have attracted considerable attention. In Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) around Minamitorishima Island, vast deposits of manganese nodules containing valuable battery metals (Co, Ni, Cu) have been discovered, with estimated reserves equivalent to more than 75 years of Japan's annual consumption.

The commercialization of manganese nodules requires the development of efficient and economical smelting processes suitable for their unique physical and chemical properties, including high water content (approximately 30 %) and porous structure. While various leaching methods have been proposed for manganese nodules from other regions, the applicability of these methods to nodules from the Minamitorishima area, which exhibit different compositions and physical characteristics, has not been sufficiently verified.

This study aimed to evaluate and compare three leaching methods for manganese nodules collected from the Minamitorishima area: sulfuric acid leaching, oxalic acid leaching, and ammonia-ammonium carbonate solution leaching. Leaching experiments were conducted under various conditions, and the leaching rates of Ni, Co, Cu, Mn, and Fe were determined. Additionally, the economic viability of each process was evaluated based on reagent costs, energy costs, processing time, and recovery rates of valuable metals.

The nodules contained Mn (16.11 wt %), Fe (17.00 wt %), Co (3,712 ppm), Ni (2,008 ppm), and Cu (1,654 ppm). Sulfuric acid leaching at 100 °C, 2 M, 120 minutes recovered nearly 100 % of Ni and Cu but only ~23 % of Co. Oxalic acid leaching at 0.3 M and 25 °C for 120 minutes achieved ~100 % recovery for Ni, Co, and Cu, yet simultaneously dissolved Mn and Fe; during subsequent purification, oxalate precipitation may cause co-precipitation of Ni/Co/Cu, representing a remaining technical challenge. Ammonia–ammonium carbonate leaching of unroasted samples at 50 °C with 15 % NH~3~-9 % CO~2~ for 120 minutes yielded low recoveries (Cu ~46 %, Ni ~7.5 %, Co ~2.1 %).

Economic comparison factoring reagent and energy costs, processing time, and recoverable metal quantities showed sulfuric acid leaching had the smallest loss margin (recovery value ~97 USD vs. costs ~302 USD/t), making it relatively most favorable. Oxalic acid leaching benefits from low thermal demand, but oxalate-induced metal loss and high reagent costs resulted in large losses (▲1,648 USD/t). Ammonia–ammonium carbonate leaching had low recovery values and the highest combined reagent, heating, and roasting costs, yielding the poorest economics (▲34,993–▲34,999 USD/t). Currently, none of the processes are profitable, and cost reduction and recovery improvement are essential.

Overall, sulfuric acid leaching at 100 °C, 2 M, 120 minutes is the most promising route for Minamitorishima nodules at the current stage. Improving Co recovery (~23 %) is essential, and mitigating oxalate-induced metal loss in oxalic acid leaching, improving recovery rates and reducing roasting/heating costs in ammonia-based leaching, and scale-up testing are important future research topics toward commercial deployment.
