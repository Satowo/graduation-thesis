Abstract

The global transition toward carbon neutrality by 2050 has led to a surge in demand for battery metals—essential components for lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles and stationary energy storage systems. According to projections by the International Energy Agency (IEA), demand for lithium is expected to increase approximately 13-fold, while cobalt and nickel demand is projected to increase more than 6-fold over the next two decades. However, the supply of these critical metals faces significant risks due to resource concentration in specific countries and geopolitical factors. For instance, approximately 70 % of global cobalt production is concentrated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, while lithium production is heavily dependent on the "Lithium Triangle" in South America and Australia. As a potential solution to ensure stable supply, deep-sea mineral resources, particularly manganese nodules, have attracted considerable attention. In Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) around Minamitorishima Island, vast deposits of manganese nodules containing valuable battery metals (Co, Ni, Cu) have been discovered, with estimated reserves equivalent to more than 75 years of Japan's annual consumption.

The commercialization of manganese nodules requires the development of efficient and economical smelting processes suitable for their unique physical and chemical properties, including high water content (approximately 30 %) and porous structure. While various leaching methods have been proposed for manganese nodules from other regions, the applicability of these methods to nodules from the Minamitorishima area, which exhibit different compositions and physical characteristics, has not been sufficiently verified.

This study aimed to evaluate and compare three leaching methods for manganese nodules collected from the Minamitorishima area: sulfuric acid leaching, oxalic acid leaching, and ammonia-ammonium carbonate solution leaching. Leaching experiments were conducted under various conditions, and the leaching rates of Ni, Co, Cu, Mn, and Fe were determined. Additionally, the economic viability of each process was evaluated based on reagent costs, energy costs, processing time, and recovery rates of valuable metals.

The nodules contained Mn (16.11 wt %), Fe (17.00 wt %), Co (3,712 ppm), Ni (2,008 ppm), and Cu (1,654 ppm). Sulfuric acid leaching of unroasted samples at 100 °C, 2 M, 120 minutes recovered nearly 100 % of Ni and Cu but only ~23 % of Co. However, reductive roasting at 600 °C in air atmosphere with 10 wt. % carbon addition for 3 hours significantly improved leachability by reducing Mn^4+^ to Mn^2+^ and altering the crystal structure. Sulfuric acid leaching of roasted samples at 75 °C, 2 M, 180 minutes achieved high recovery rates: Ni 94.8 %, Cu 98.3 %, and Co 94.8 %, resolving the Co recovery challenge. Additionally, Mn was recovered at 61.4 % leaching rate. Oxalic acid leaching at 0.3 M and 25 °C for 120 minutes achieved ~100 % recovery for Ni, Co, and Cu, yet simultaneously dissolved Mn and Fe; during subsequent purification, oxalate precipitation may cause co-precipitation of Ni/Co/Cu, representing a remaining technical challenge. Ammonia–ammonium carbonate leaching of unroasted samples at 50 °C with 15 % NH~3~-9 % CO~2~ for 120 minutes yielded low recoveries (Cu ~46 %, Ni ~7.5 %, Co ~2.1 %) and was excluded from further evaluation.

Economic comparison factoring reagent and energy costs, processing time, and recoverable metal quantities showed that sulfuric acid leaching of roasted samples (75 °C, 2 M, 180 minutes) achieved a recovery value of ~442 USD/t (Ni, Co, Cu ~195 USD plus Mn as manganese sulfate ~247 USD) against total costs of ~388–394 USD/t, resulting in a positive margin of ~48–54 USD/t—the only profitable process among those evaluated. Oxalic acid leaching benefits from low thermal demand, but oxalate-induced metal loss and high reagent costs resulted in large losses (▲1,648 USD/t).

Overall, a process flow of roasting → sulfuric acid leaching → pH adjustment for Fe removal → staged separation/recovery is the most suitable for Minamitorishima nodules. Specifically, reductive roasting improves leachability, sulfuric acid leaching recovers Ni, Co, and Cu at high rates, and subsequent hydrometallurgical separation can be designed based on prior work on sulfate leach liquors (Parween et al., 2025), e.g., Fe removal by pH adjustment followed by stepwise recovery of Cu/Co/Ni and Mn. This process flow represents a promising option for commercial deployment. Future research topics include further improving profitability by recovering unleached Mn, scale-up testing, environmental cost assessment, and process optimization for practical application.
